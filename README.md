# VW103 - MIDI to CV converter module
This is the source code for a MIDI to CV converter based on a STM32 BlackPill board. It's designed for eurorack but can be used with any physical format. Code changes might be required for different electrical formats. (this is +/- 12V)
The code uses Zephyr v2.2.0 RTOS from within PlatformIO (it should be fairly trivial to use the native Zephyr build system).
